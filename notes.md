IP Address to Remote server: http://44.212.167.81/

Domain name: https://shareyourbookshareyourthoughts.click/

Remote shell into server command:  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
                                
                                ssh -i CS260\$Reviewer260$.pem ubuntu@44.212.167.81
                                
                                ls -l
